== Welcome
Supporty is a work in progress, when done (or good enough for beta) it will be an open source customer support engine.

TODO:
* create Support model, callbacks, etc
* protect it from spam
* create controller
* create views
* do some basic design
* email recieving mechanism which will add email data to the ticket
* make everything customizable
* get 100% test coverage, nothing should be left untested


Instructions:
if you want to collab - fork the repo, commit your changes and issue a pull request.
* pull requests for features without tests will be rejected
* pull requests without decent documentation will get their contributor shot. well, not shot, but you know the drill :)

please don't write any english in views, all text should be internationalized, to allow for customization and stuff. so "howdy, user!" should be t("supporty.page_name.howdy", user: user.name)
